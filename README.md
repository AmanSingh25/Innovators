Tech Exchange: Unit 3 Project - Design Document
Background
Our mission is to connect users to Black-owned businesses in tech, finance,and education. By displaying these businesses, we hope to aid in the financial aspect of sustaining a company long-term. With your help, these companies will prosper and it all starts with a small donation.

Objective
On the unit 3 project, we plan to store the data collected in a database. The information provided will also be rendered on our website. Based on the type of organization the user wants to donate to, the web page will be updated for that specific type, sorted alphabetically. Unit 3 is different from unit 2 because now we are storing data as opposed to having no backend aspect. Whatever the user inputs will now be stored and able to be referred to when rendered on the “All Organizations” page and other type- specific pages (Education, Finance, Technology). .
